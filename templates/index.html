    <h3>The Statement of Problem</h3>
    <p>🌾 In many parts of the world, especially in developing regions, farmers often rely on guesswork or outdated knowledge when deciding what crop to plant. This leads to poor yield, wasted resources, and economic hardship.</p>

    <p>📊 My Crop Recommendation System uses real environmental and soil data — including Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall — to predict the most suitable crop for a given condition. With this, farmers can make smarter, data-driven decisions, increase productivity, and reduce risk.</p>

    <p>🎯 This project is built to bridge the gap between technology and agriculture, empowering farmers with actionable insights at their fingertips.</p>
